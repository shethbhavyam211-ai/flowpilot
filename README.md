# FlowPilot

**Manage projects. Collaborate better.**

A lightweight project management platform for startups, college teams, and small companies — built with React, TypeScript, and a design system that prioritizes clarity over complexity.

## Why FlowPilot?

Most project management tools fall into two camps: **enterprise suites** that require a week of onboarding, or **spreadsheet hacks** that collapse under real team load. FlowPilot exists in the middle — opinionated enough to keep teams aligned, flexible enough to adapt to how small groups actually work.

We started FlowPilot after watching three early-stage teams abandon Jira within a month and outgrow Notion boards within a quarter. The goal was never to replace every PM tool; it was to ship a focused frontend experience that teams could run locally, fork freely, and extend without fighting the codebase.

**What makes it different:**

- **Frontend-only architecture** — no backend required for development or demos; data persists via `localStorage` with simulated API delays
- **Modern Soft Brutalism UI** — thick borders, offset shadows, and bright accents that feel handcrafted, not templated
- **Modular codebase** — feature-separated folders, strict TypeScript, and reusable primitives designed for contributors

> FlowPilot is actively developed. v1.0 established the core workspace; v1.1 added authentication and a marketing landing page. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full history.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or later
- **npm** 9 or later

### Install & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowpilot/flowpilot.git
cd flowpilot
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Register an account on the landing page, then explore the workspace at `/dashboard`.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build    # type-check + Vite production bundle
npm run preview  # serve the dist/ output locally
npm run lint     # run oxlint
```

## Architecture at a Glance

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                      Browser (SPA)                      │
├──────────────┬──────────────────┬───────────────────────┤
│   Pages      │   Components     │   Context Providers   │
│  (routes)    │  layouts / ui    │  Auth · App · Toast   │
├──────────────┴──────────────────┴───────────────────────┤
│              Services (simulated async APIs)            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│         JSON seed data  ↔  localStorage persistence     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

FlowPilot deliberately keeps all state on the client. Service modules return `Promise`-based responses with configurable delays (500–1000 ms) to mimic network latency. `AppContext` hydrates from JSON seed files on first load, then reads/writes `localStorage` on subsequent visits.

For the full breakdown — routing guards, context boundaries, data flow, and folder conventions — see **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Design Philosophy

FlowPilot follows a **Modern Soft Brutalism** aesthetic: roughly 70% polished SaaS, 30% playful brutalist accents.

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Strong hierarchy | Manrope type scale, extrabold headings, generous whitespace |
| Tactile surfaces | 2.5px `#111827` borders, offset `shadow-brutal` boxes |
| Energetic palette | Blue, orange, yellow, emerald, pink, purple on `#FFFDF7` |
| Motion with purpose | Framer Motion for page transitions, counters, and modals — not decoration |
| Accessible contrast | High-contrast ink-on-cream; interactive elements always bordered |

Component-level rules live in **[STYLEGUIDE.md](STYLEGUIDE.md)**.

## Performance Goals

FlowPilot targets a snappy client-side experience on mid-range hardware:

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| First Contentful Paint | < 1.2 s | Vite code-splitting planned for v1.2 |
| Time to Interactive | < 2.5 s | On 4G, uncached |
| Production JS bundle | < 400 KB gzip | Currently ~326 KB — tracked in CI |
| Lighthouse Performance | ≥ 90 | Landing and dashboard pages |
| Route transition | < 200 ms | Framer Motion page fade |

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for bundle-splitting and lazy-loading milestones.
